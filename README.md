# odin-recipes
<h3>Project repository covering HTML foundations</h3>
In this project, I will build a basic website showcasing three recipes, through the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Build index.html and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes".</li>
  <li>Link to a page for a recipe.</li>
  <li>Start with the recipe's name, followed by the iamge of the recipe.</li>
  <li>Show ingredients in an unordered list and instructions in an ordered list.</li>
  <li>Using the above process, add in two more recipes</li>
</ol>
 
Through this project, I'll practice working with text, images, lists and links. I'll also get some experience in good practices on directory structure and commit messages.
